# OOP Basics with Java questions

## Java ecosystem

**- What is the JVM?**
<br />The JVM, or Java Virtual Machine, is a crucial component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 
that allows Java code to run on any platform or operating system without recompilation. 
The JVM interprets compiled Java code (known as bytecode) and converts it into machine code that can be executed by the underlying hardware.

**- What does Java compilation mean?**
<br />Java compilation is the process of translating human-readable Java source code into machine-readable 
bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

**- What is Java bytecode?**
<br />Java bytecode is a binary format that is generated by compiling Java source code. 
It is a set of instructions that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
which is a software layer that interprets and executes the bytecode on different hardware and operating systems.

**- What is the difference between the JRE and the JDK?**
<br />The JRE and JDK are both software packages that are used to run Java programs, but they have different purposes and components.

The JRE, or Java Runtime Environment, is a software package that includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
Java class libraries, and other components that are necessary to run Java applications. 
It is intended for end-users who want to run Java applications but do not need to develop Java programs themselves. 
The JRE does not include the Java compiler or other development tools.

The JDK, or Java Development Kit, is a software package that includes the JRE, Java compiler, debugging tools, 
and other development tools that are necessary to develop Java applications. It is intended for developers who want to 
create Java applications and applets. The JDK includes everything in the JRE, as well as additional tools for development 
and testing.

In summary, the JRE is used to run Java applications, while the JDK is used to develop Java applications. 
The JRE includes the JVM and Java libraries, while the JDK includes everything in the JRE plus development tools 
such as the Java compiler and debugging tools.

**- What is the `Iterable` interface?**
<br />The Iterable interface in Java is a fundamental interface in the Java Collections Framework. 
It is used to represent a collection of elements that can be iterated over using a for-each loop or 
other iteration techniques.

**- What is the `Collection` interface?**
<br />The Collection interface in Java is a fundamental interface in the Java Collections Framework. 
It is a high-level interface that represents a group of objects, known as elements, and provides methods to manipulate them.
The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface, which means that any class that implements the Collection 
interface can be iterated over using the for-each loop or other iteration techniques. 
It defines several methods for adding, removing, and querying elements in the collection.

**- What is the `Map` interface?**
<br />The Map interface in Java is a fundamental interface in the Java Collections Framework. 
It represents a mapping between a set of keys and a set of values, where each key is associated with one value. 
It is also known as an associative array or a dictionary in other programming languages.

**- Compare sets, lists, and queues in Java.**
<br />Sets: Sets are collections that contain no duplicate elements. 
They are typically used when the presence of duplicates is not desirable, and the order in which elements are stored is not important. 
The Set interface provides methods such as add(), remove(), and contains(), and implementations of the Set interface include HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. 
Examples of use cases for sets include keeping track of unique elements in a collection or checking if a particular element exists in a collection.

Lists: Lists are ordered collections that can contain duplicate elements. 
They are typically used when the order of elements is important, and duplicates are allowed. 
The List interface provides methods such as add(), remove(), and get(), and implementations of the List interface 
include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector. Examples of use cases for lists include maintaining a collection of items in 
a specific order or searching for an element at a particular index.

Queues: Queues are collections that order elements in a FIFO (first-in, first-out) manner. 
They are typically used when the order in which elements are processed is important. The Queue interface provides 
methods such as add(), remove(), and peek(), and implementations of the Queue interface include LinkedList and PriorityQueue. 
Examples of use cases for queues include processing tasks in the order they are received, implementing a 
messaging system, or simulating a line of people waiting for a service.

**- Compare `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in Java.**
<br />Implementation: ArrayList is implemented as a dynamic array, which means that it stores its elements in a 
contiguous block of memory and can be accessed directly using an index. LinkedList, 
on the other hand, is implemented as a doubly linked list, which means that it stores its elements as a sequence 
of nodes that are connected by links or pointers.

In summary, ArrayList is a good choice when fast random access is required, while LinkedList is a good choice 
when fast insertion and deletion are required, and when memory usage is not a concern. The choice between ArrayList 
and LinkedList depends on the specific requirements of the use case.

**- Are sets sorted in Java?**
<br />In summary, sets in Java are not sorted by default, but some 
implementations of the Set interface, such as TreeSet, do provide sorted sets.


## Language features

**- What control statements are available in Java?**
<br />Selection statements: if-else, switch.
Iteration statements: for, while, do-while.
Jump statements: break, continue, return, and try-catch-finally.

**- Compare the different looping constructs in Java.**
<br />for: It is a pre-test loop that executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 
The loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and update. It is typically used when the number of 
iterations is known in advance.

while: It is a pre-test loop that executes a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 
It only consists of a condition, and the loop will continue as long as the condition is true. It is typically used 
when the number of iterations is unknown.

do-while: It is a post-test loop that executes a block of code once and then repeatedly executes the block until a 
specified condition is met. It consists of a condition and a loop body. The loop will continue as long as the condition 
is true. It is typically used when the block of code must be executed at least once.

**- Compare the different conditional constructs in Java.**
<br />if-else: It executes a block of code if a specified condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.
switch: It executes a block of code depending on the value of a specified expression. It is typically used when there
are multiple possible values for the expression.

**- What is a `while` loop?**
<br />while is a pre-test looping construct in Java that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified 
condition is true. It only consists of a condition, and the loop will continue as long as the condition is true. 
The syntax of a while loop is as follows:

**- How do you manually break out of a loop?**
<br />In Java, you can manually break out of a loop using the break statement. The break statement immediately terminates the innermost loop it is located in.

**- What does the `var` keyword mean?**
<br />var is a type inference keyword introduced in Java 10. It allows you to declare a local variable without specifying 
its type explicitly. Instead, the type is inferred from the initializer expression on the right-hand side of the declaration.

**- What are _lambda expressions_? How are they used in Java development?**
<br />Lambda expressions are a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows you to treat functions as first-class citizens. 
A lambda expression is a way to express a function in a compact and concise manner.
It consists of a list of parameters, an arrow ->, and a body that specifies the implementation of the function.


## Type system

**- What are primitive types in Java? Give some examples.**
<br />In Java, primitive types are the basic data types that are built into the language and are not objects. 
They are represented directly as bits in memory and have a fixed size and range of values. 
Some examples of primitive types in Java are:
int: integer type, 4 bytes, range -2^31 to 2^31-1
double: floating-point type, 8 bytes, range ±4.9 × 10^-324 to ±1.8 × 10^308
boolean: boolean type, 1 bit, value true or false
char: character type, 2 bytes, Unicode character set, range \u0000 to \uffff

**- What is the difference between primitive types and reference types?**
<br />Primitive types are basic data types that are not objects, and are stored directly in memory. 
They are passed by value, meaning that when a primitive value is passed as an argument to a method or assigned to a variable, a copy of the value is made.
Reference types, on the other hand, are data types that refer to objects stored in memory. 
They are passed by reference, meaning that when a reference value is passed as an argument to a method or assigned 
to a variable, a copy of the reference to the object is made, not a copy of the object itself.
Some examples of reference types in Java are classes, interfaces, arrays, and strings.

**- What is a class in Java?**
<br />In Java, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects of a certain type. It defines the properties and behaviors of the objects, 
including their fields (variables) and methods (functions). A class is declared using the class keyword, 
followed by the class name, and can include optional modifiers, superclass, interfaces, and the class body.

**- What is an object in Java?**
<br />An object in Java is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the properties and behaviors 
defined by the class, with its own set of field values and method implementations. 
Objects are created using the new keyword, followed by the class name and optional constructor arguments.

**- What is a constructor?**
<br />A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object of a class is created using the new keyword.
It is used to initialize the fields of the object to specific values or perform any necessary setup tasks. 
A constructor has the same name as the class, and can take zero or more parameters. If no constructor is explicitly 
defined in a class, a default constructor with no arguments is provided automatically.

**- What is an `enum` in Java?**
<br />An enum in Java is a special type of class that represents a fixed set of constants or values. 
It is declared using the enum keyword, followed by the enum name and the list of constant values enclosed in braces. 
Each constant value is an instance of the enum class, with its own name and optional parameters.

**- Explain the difference between a class and an enum.**
<br />A class in Java is a blueprint for creating objects of a certain type, and can have multiple instances with different 
field values and method implementations. An enum, on the other hand, is a special type of class that represents a fixed set 
of constant values, and is typically used to define a type with a small and well-defined set of possible values. 
An enum can have multiple instances, but they are typically predefined and cannot be modified at runtime.

**- Explain the difference between a class and a record.**
<br />The main difference between a class and a record is that a record is a more concise way to define a class that 
primarily stores data, whereas a class is a more general-purpose template for creating objects with behavior and state. 
Records are immutable by default and provide a compact and easily-readable syntax for defining classes with a fixed 
set of properties. Classes, on the other hand, provide more flexibility and can define methods and members that have 
complex behavior beyond simple data storage.

**- What are interfaces? Why should we use them?**
<br />In Java, an interface is a collection of abstract methods that define a set of behavior without providing any 
implementation details. It is a way to specify what needs to be done without specifying how it should be done.

**- What is inheritance?**
<br />Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class 
(called the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behavior of another class (called the superclass or base class). 
The subclass can then extend or modify the behavior of the superclass, while still maintaining its original properties.

**- Is multiple inheritance allowed in Java?**
<br />No, Java does not allow multiple inheritance of classes. However, a class can implement multiple interfaces.

**- What is a static class member?**
<br />A static class member is a member (field or method) of a class that belongs to the class itself, 
rather than any instance of the class. This means that the member can be accessed using the class name, rather than an object of the class.

**- Can a static method use non-static members?**
<br />No, a static method cannot access non-static members of a class. This is because non-static members belong to an 
instance of the class, while a static method does not have access to any specific instance.

**- What does the `final` keyword mean in Java?**
<br />The final keyword can be used to specify that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified or extended once 
it has been defined. A final variable cannot be reassigned, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final class cannot be subclassed.

**- What does the `abstract` keyword mean in Java?**
<br />The abstract keyword can be used to specify that a class or method is incomplete and must be implemented by a subclass.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated, and any subclass must implement all abstract methods. 
An abstract method must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

**- What is _overloading_ in Java?**
<br />Overloading is a feature in Java that allows multiple methods to have the same name, as long as they have different parameters. 
This is useful for creating methods that perform similar operations on different types of data or with different numbers of arguments.

**- What is _overriding_ in Java?**
<br />Overriding is a feature in Java that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined 
in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass.

**- What is the difference between overloading and overriding?**
<br />Overloading involves creating multiple methods with the same name in the same class, while overriding involves providing a specific 
implementation of a method in a subclass that is already defined in its superclass. Overloading is resolved at compile time 
based on the method signature, while overriding is resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the object being used.

**- What is `null`?**
<br />null is a special value in Java that represents the absence of an object reference. It is often used to initialize 
variables that will later refer to an object, but have no initial value.

**- Compare the access modifiers in Java.**
<br />Java provides four access modifiers that control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables:
public, private, protected, and the default (no modifier). 
public members can be accessed from anywhere, private members can only be accessed within the same class, protected members 
can be accessed within the same package or by subclasses, and the default modifier allows access within the same package only.

**- What is the default access modifier in a class?**
<br />The default access modifier for a class is package-private. This means that the class is only accessible within the same package.

**- What is the purpose of the `equals()` method?**
<br />The equals() method is used to compare two objects for equality. It is typically used to compare the contents of two objects, 
rather than their memory addresses. By default, the equals() method compares object references for equality, 
but it can be overridden in a class to provide a specific implementation for comparing object contents.

**- What is the difference between `==` and `equals()`?**
<br />The == operator checks if two objects are the same object in memory, while the equals() method checks if two objects 
have the same value. In other words, == checks for reference equality, while equals() checks for value equality.

**- What is the difference between `long` and `Long`?**
<br />long is a primitive data type in Java that can store a 64-bit signed integer value, while Long is a wrapper class for 
the long primitive type. Long provides a way to use long values as objects, allowing them to be used in situations where an object is required (such as collections).


**- Which can store bigger numbers, `long` or `Long`?**
<br />Both long and Long can store the same range of values, but Long has additional methods and can be used in 
situations where an object is required (such as collections).

**- What kind of packages do you know under `java.util.*` ? Bring at least 3 examples.**
<br />java.util.ArrayList: Implements a dynamic array that can grow and shrink as needed.
java.util.HashMap: Implements a hash table, which stores key-value pairs using a hash function.
java.util.Scanner: Provides methods for parsing input streams into tokens of various types.



## Architecture

**- Explain the Single Responsibility Principle.**
<br />The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a software design principle that states that a class or module should 
have only one reason to change. In other words, a class or module should have only one responsibility or job, and that 
job should be encapsulated within the class or module. This principle encourages developers to create smaller, 
more focused classes that are easier to understand, modify, and test.

**- Explain the Interface Segregation Principle.**
<br />The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a software design principle that states that clients should not be forced 
to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, interfaces should be designed to be as small and focused as 
possible, so that clients only need to implement the methods that they actually need. This principle helps to reduce 
the complexity of code and promotes modularity and flexibility.

**- What is _composition over inheritance_?**
<br />Composition over inheritance is a design principle that suggests that classes should achieve code reuse by composing 
functionality from other classes rather than inheriting it. In other words, instead of creating a new class that 
inherits all the functionality of an existing class, developers should create a new class that contains instances 
of the existing class as members. This approach promotes more flexible and maintainable code, as it allows for more 
dynamic composition of behavior at runtime.

**- What is a model class?**
<br />A model class is a class that represents a specific data entity or concept within an application. 
For example, in a web application that manages user accounts, a model class might represent a user account 
and contain properties such as the user's name, email address, and password. Model classes are typically used 
to encapsulate data and behavior related to specific concepts within an application.

**- What is a service class?**
<br />A service class is a class that provides a specific service or functionality within an application. 
For example, in a web application that manages user accounts, a service class might provide methods for 
creating, updating, and deleting user accounts, as well as methods for retrieving user account information. 
Service classes are typically used to encapsulate complex business logic and provide a clear, high-level interface 
for interacting with the application's functionality.

**- Explain the Open/Closed principle.**
<br />The Open/Closed principle is a software design principle that states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) 
should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, once a software entity is created, its behavior 
should be fixed and stable, but it should be designed in a way that allows new behavior to be added without modifying the existing code.

**- Explain the Liskov Substitution Principle.**
<br />The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a software design principle that states that any instance of a subclass 
should be able to be used in place of an instance of its superclass without causing errors or unexpected behavior. 
In other words, a subclass should be able to extend the behavior of its superclass without altering its functionality or violating its contracts.

**- Explain the Dependency Inversion Principle.**
<br />The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a software design principle that states that high-level modules should not 
depend on low-level modules, but instead both should depend on abstractions. In other words, the principle encourages 
the use of interfaces and abstract classes to decouple modules and promote flexibility and maintainability.

**- What do we mean by the Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns? Can you name some of these patterns?**
<br />Factory Method: a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which classes to instantiate.
Adapter: a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by creating a bridge between them.
Observer: a behavioral pattern that allows objects to be notified when a change occurs in another object.
Strategy: a behavioral pattern that allows different algorithms or behaviors to be selected at runtime.

**- What are the risks associated with using the GoF design patterns?**
<br />Over-engineering: using design patterns where they are not necessary can lead to overly complex and difficult-to-maintain code.
Misunderstanding: incorrectly applying a design pattern or not fully understanding its implications can lead to bugs, errors, and other problems.
Rigidity: some design patterns can make it difficult to change the system's behavior or add new functionality, especially if they are implemented in a rigid or inflexible way.

**- What do we mean by YAGNI?**
<br />YAGNI stands for "You Ain't Gonna Need It" and is a principle of extreme programming (XP) that encourages developers 
to only implement functionality that is needed right now, rather than trying to anticipate future needs or requirements. 
This principle helps to reduce complexity and waste in the development process, and can lead to more focused, maintainable code.

**- What do we mean by SLAP?**
<br />SLAP stands for "Single Level of Abstraction Principle" and is a software design principle that states that each function 
or method should perform only one level of abstraction. In other words, a function or method should either perform low-level 
operations or high-level operations, but not both. This principle helps to improve code readability and maintainability by reducing complexity and increasing clarity.

**- What do we mean by KISS?**
<br />- This principle helps to reduce the risk of bugs and errors, and can lead to more maintainable, understandable code.
KISS stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid" and is a principle of design and problem-solving that emphasizes the importance of simplicity and avoiding unnecessary complexity. The KISS principle is used in many fields, including software design, engineering, and communications.

**- What is the Repository Pattern?**
<br />The Repository Pattern is a software design pattern that provides an abstraction layer between the application code and the data 
storage layer of the system. The pattern encapsulates the logic required to access and manipulate data within a dedicated object called a "repository".
Overall, the Repository Pattern promotes better code organization, reduces coupling between different components of the system, 
and makes it easier to switch between different data storage technologies without affecting the application code.

**- What is a CRUD interface?**
<br />Create: This operation is used to create new data in the system.
Read: This operation is used to retrieve existing data from the system.
Update: This operation is used to modify existing data in the system.
Delete: This operation is used to remove data from the system.
Overall, a CRUD interface provides a convenient and consistent way to manage data in a system, and is a common feature in many software applications.


## Unit testing
**- Why is unit testing a good practice?**
<br />It helps to catch bugs and errors early in the development process, when they are less costly to fix.
It provides developers with confidence that changes or updates they make to the codebase will not introduce new bugs or issues.
It helps to ensure that each component of the code is functioning as intended and can be tested independently from the rest of the application.
It encourages developers to write code that is modular and maintainable, making it easier to refactor and update in the future.

**- What is JUnit?**
<br />JUnit is a popular open-source testing framework for Java that provides a simple and easy-to-use platform for writing 
and running unit tests. It provides a set of annotations and assertion methods that allow developers to define test 
cases and verify that their code behaves as expected.

**- What is a parameterized test?**
<br />A parameterized test is a type of unit test where the same test logic is executed multiple times with different input values. 
The input values are typically specified in a table or a list, allowing developers to test multiple scenarios with a single test method.

**- What options do you have in NUnit to create parameterized tests?**
<br />NUnit is a testing framework for .NET languages that provides several options for creating parameterized tests, including:
TestCase attribute: Allows developers to specify a set of input values and expected results for a single test method.
TestCaseSource attribute: Allows developers to specify a method that returns a set of input values and expected results to be used in multiple test methods.
ValueSource attribute: Allows developers to specify a set of input values for a single test method.

**- What is _mocking_?**
<br />Mocking is a technique used in unit testing to simulate the behavior of a complex system or component by creating a 
simplified version of it that can be controlled and observed during testing. Mock objects are typically used to isolate 
the code being tested from its dependencies and to verify that the code interacts correctly with those dependencies.

**- What is the difference between _mocking_, _stubbing_ and _faking_?**
<br />Mocking involves creating a fake object that simulates the behavior of a real object or system, allowing developers to 
test their code in isolation from its dependencies.

Stubbing involves creating a simplified version of a real object or system that returns predetermined values or behaviors, 
allowing developers to test specific scenarios without requiring the full complexity of the real system.

Faking involves creating a replacement for a real object or system that provides similar functionality but is simpler 
or easier to control, allowing developers to test their code in isolation while still interacting with a realistic implementation of the system.


## Databases

**- What are relational databases? What are their advantages and disadvantages?**
<br />Relational databases are a type of database that stores data in tables with pre-defined relationships between them. 
The relationships are established through the use of keys that link data between tables. Relational databases offer several advantages, including:

Data consistency: The use of pre-defined relationships and constraints helps ensure that data is consistent across the database.
Scalability: Relational databases can handle large amounts of data and can be easily scaled as the data volume grows.
Flexibility: Relational databases support a wide range of data types and can be used for a variety of applications.

However, relational databases also have some disadvantages, including:

Complexity: Setting up and maintaining a relational database can be complex, and requires a good understanding of database design principles.
Performance: As the data volume grows, the performance of a relational database can degrade if not properly optimized.
Cost: Relational databases can be expensive to license and maintain, especially for large-scale deployments.

**- How do you associate entities to each other in a relational database model?**
<br />Entities in a relational database model are associated with each other through the use of foreign keys. 
A foreign key is a field in one table that references the primary key of another table. By using foreign keys, 
tables can be linked together to establish relationships between them. For example, a customer table might have a 
foreign key that references an order table, linking each customer to the orders they have placed.

**- What are tables in a relational database?**
<br />Tables in a relational database are the fundamental building blocks of the database. 
A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns, where each row represents a single instance of 
the data and each column represents a specific attribute or property of the data. Tables are linked together 
through the use of keys, allowing data to be shared and linked across multiple tables in the database.

**- What is a _primary key_?**
<br />A primary key is a field or combination of fields in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. 
The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record can be uniquely identified and accessed. 
Typically, the primary key is assigned automatically by the database system when a new record is added to the table.

**- What is a _foreign key_?**
<br />A foreign key is a field or combination of fields in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. 
The foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables and enforce referential integrity. 
This ensures that data in one table cannot be deleted or modified if it is referenced by another table.

**- What does the SQL abbreviation stand for?**
<br />SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
It is used to create and modify database schemas, insert, update and delete data, and retrieve data from the database. 
SQL is a standard language used by most relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

**- What are some of the SQL database providers that you’ve heard of?**
<br />There are many SQL database providers available, including:
MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SSQLite, IBM DB2, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora

**- What are SQL data types? Are there any differences in data types between different SQL databases?**
<br />SQL data types define the type of data that can be stored in a database column. Some common SQL data types include:
Integer: Used for storing whole numbers.
Decimal/numeric: Used for storing floating point numbers with decimal precision.
Char/varchar: Used for storing character strings.
Date/time: Used for storing dates and times.
There can be differences in data types between different SQL databases, such as differences in the maximum length of varchar columns or the precision of decimal/numeric columns.

**- What are _constraints_ in SQL?**
<br />Constraints in SQL are rules that are applied to database tables to enforce data integrity and ensure that data conforms to specific rules or conditions. Some common types of constraints include:
Primary key: Ensures that each row in a table has a unique identifier.
Foreign key: Ensures that data in one table is consistent with data in another table.
Unique: Ensures that a column or combination of columns contains only unique values.
Not null: Ensures that a column cannot contain null values.
Check: Ensures that data in a column satisfies a specific condition or set of conditions.

**- How can we program different SQL databases in Java? **
<br /> JDBC API: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a standard API for connecting to and interacting with databases from Java programs. 
JDBC provides a set of classes and interfaces that allow you to connect to a database, execute SQL statements, and retrieve results. 
To use JDBC, you will need to write code to load the appropriate JDBC driver for the database you want to use, and then use the JDBC API to interact with the database.

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks: ORM frameworks such as Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistence API) provide a higher-level abstraction for working with databases in Java. 
These frameworks map Java objects to database tables and provide a set of APIs for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the objects. 
ORM frameworks can simplify database programming by reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed to interact with the database, and by providing a more natural programming model.

**- Which SQL statement is used to create tables? Describe the syntax briefly.**
<br />CREATE TABLE is the SQL keyword used to create a new table.
table_name is the name of the table you want to create.
column1, column2, ..., columnN are the columns you want to create in the table.
datatype specifies the data type of the column.
constraint is an optional parameter that can be used to specify additional constraints on the column, such as primary key, foreign key, not null, unique, etc.
For example, to create a table named "customers" with columns for "customer_id", "first_name", "last_name", and "email", with "customer_id" as the primary key, the following SQL statement can be used:

**- Which SQL statement can be used to insert values? Describe the syntax briefly.**
<br />INSERT INTO is the SQL keyword used to insert new rows into a table.
table_name is the name of the table you want to insert data into.
(column1, column2, ..., columnN) is an optional parameter that specifies the columns you want to insert data into. 
If you omit this parameter, the values will be inserted into all columns in the order they appear in the table.

VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN) specifies the values you want to insert into the specified columns. 
The number of values you specify must match the number of columns you are inserting into, and the data types of the values must match the data types of the columns.
For example, to insert a new row into the "customers" table created in the previous question with the following values: 1, "John", "Doe", and "johndoe@example.com", the following SQL statement can be used:

**- Which SQL statement can be used to update values? Describe the syntax briefly.**
<br />The SQL statement that can be used to update values in a database is the UPDATE statement. The syntax of the UPDATE statement is as follows:
  
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
    WHERE condition;

  This statement updates one or more columns in a table with new values. 
  The SET clause specifies the columns to update and the new values to set, while the WHERE clause specifies which rows to update.
  
**- Which SQL statement can be used to delete rows?. Describe the syntax briefly.**
<br /> The SQL statement that can be used to delete rows from a database is the DELETE statement. The syntax of the DELETE statement is as follows:
  
<br />  DELETE FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
<br />This statement deletes one or more rows from a table based on the specified condition in the WHERE clause.

**- Which SQL statement can be used to create queries?. Describe the syntax briefly.**
<br /> The SQL statement that can be used to create queries is the SELECT statement. The syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows:
<br />    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
<br />This statement retrieves data from one or more tables based on the specified columns and conditions in the SELECT and WHERE clauses. 
The ORDER BY clause can be used to sort the results in ascending or descending order.

**- How can you join tables together in SQL? When should you do it?**
<br />To join tables together in SQL, you can use the JOIN clause. 
You should join tables when you need to combine data from two or more tables into a single result set.
There are several types of joins in SQL, including:
<br />  INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
<br />  LEFT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. If there is no match in the right table, the result will contain NULL values.
<br />  RIGHT JOIN: Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. If there is no match in the left table, the result will contain NULL values.
<br />  FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all the rows from both tables, including the rows that have no matching values in either table.
  The syntax for a basic INNER JOIN is as follows:

<br />  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table1
  INNER JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
<br />This statement joins table1 and table2 on the specified column and returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
